I remember when I was restoring pinball machines that I learned a very important lesson about computer repair. I accidentally caused mainboard damage to a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_2000[Pinball 2000] (Pin2K) game: http://www.ipdb.org/search.pl?any=star+wars&search=Search+Database&searchtype=quick#4458[Star Wars: Episode 1].  It is very easy to do, because the two Molex connectors from the ATX power supply were not http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_connector#Keying[keyed], and you could reverse the ground for power. I did this, and took out the power circuit on the mainboard.

This was a *big* problem, because the Pin2K mainboards were a BAT-style PC mainboard (running a Cyrix Media GX CPU which was connected to a Cyrix CX5520 bridge). These motherboards were used mainly in set-top boxes such as cable TV systems. The Pin2K series used a PCI custom card called a PRISM card. This card contained all the game logic, sound effects, and video packages for the games. If the power spike travelled to the PRISM card, you basically had yourself a fantastic $8000 piece of furniture.

At the time, the machine was mothballed.

I discovered that http://www.bigguyspinball.com/index.shtml[Big Guys Pinball] have reverse engineered the Pin2K core, and created some custom boards which can be used to replace damaged Pin2K logic box systems. The new system is called *nucore*.

The great thing is they are using Linux (Ubuntu), and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf[COTS] motherboards and Video Cards, to make this system a reality. You can purchase the components separately, or as a plug-and-play system ready for production use.

Hooray for Open Source, and Ingenuity!

*Update*

Unfortunately the Big Guys at Big Guys Pinball ran into a little bit of strife in 2014 during the pinball resurgence. I believe they were kindly asked to discontinue producing these boards because http://www.planetarypinball.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?[Planetary Pinball] had the exclusive rights to reproduce all Bally and Williams parts (including, unfortunately, the Pin2K hardware system). To date, I am not aware of any efforts to resume production. This is a real shame, and unless Planetary Pinball get their act together, it may see the end of crippled Pin2K units.
