I've discovered a way to get basic UI controls in The Pinball Arcade, which lets you access almost all UI buttons relevant from starting the app, selecting a table, starting the game, then exiting all the way back to the Android Home Screen. 

The only thing you can't do cleanly is scroll the table carousel, but you can implement a mouse swipe that gets around it. It's not as clean as I would have like though.

You need to have a Shield Tablet and Shield Tablet Controller to use this solution. The Shield Tablet

I put my UX hat on and tried to emulate the menu selection patterns in the PS3/PS4. The reason was to ensure I had a consistent mapping between primary and secondary button commands. 

NOTE: It it not possible to do this with a normal gamepad mapper program that requires a rooted device to access the touchscreen emulation framework. *Unless* the program has multiple pages available for keymaps.

I was able to do this because the NVidia Shield Gamepad Mapper software allows you to create separate _Pages_ that allow you to break up control schemes based on button presses. You'll see what I mean by this when you look at the images and the button labels. 

I'm not sure whether apps like Dancing Pixel's _SixAxis_ app supports multiple pages. If it does, I'll definitely update this post. 

Here are the mappings in pictorial form.

.Splash Screen

`A` will get past the initial splash screen and take you to the Main Menu

.Main Menu

`A` will take you to the Table Carousel.

`B` will take you to the Tournaments menu. 

NOTE: I need to do more work on the Tournament UI commands, and I couldn't at the time of writing because there wasn't an active tournament running.

.Table Carousel

`A` takes you to the Table Flyover screen.

`B` takes to back to the Main Menu.

Unfortunatley you will need to use your finger here to scroll the carousel. You can implement a Mouse Gesture by dragging the "Pointy Finger" element onto the carousel and setting a button to trigger the mouse click so you can tap and drag. Really cludgy, but it is the only way to get around this UX issue.

.Table Flyover

`A` starts the game and enters Game Mode.

`B` takes to back to the Table Carousel.

.Game Mode

`B` opens the Options menu (also called the Pause menu).

`X` cycles through the views (both table and plunger). Long pressing this button locks the view from scrolling in table views.

.Pause Menu

`A` returns you back to Game Mode.

`B` opens the Quit Table menu.

.Quit Table Menu

`A` returns you back to Game Mode.

`B` opens the Quit Table menu.
