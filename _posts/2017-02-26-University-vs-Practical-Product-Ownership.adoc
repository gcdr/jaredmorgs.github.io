= University vs Practical Product Ownership

I see that a Product Manager typically has a university degree. 

I don't.

I'm a Certified Scrum Product Owner though.

== Argument

What if it's possible that a University degree is a nice to have for a Product Manager?

What if I immerse myself in knowledge available in the form of Product Manager posts, podcasts, and subscriptions to industry leaders. 

== Measurement

I'll test whether I begin to notice a shift in the way I manage my products by mid year, which will suggest I'm learning by osmosis.

I've already got a fair few podcasts and subscriptions going, but I'm hungry for more perspectives.

== Motivation

I'm not afraid to talk about what I don't know so my peers can tell me what I perhaps _should_ know.

So join the experiment if you will and see what I discover.
