= Being Switzerland Has Its Advantages

If you adopt a neutral and approachable presence —or "Be the Switzerland Of Your Organisation", if you will— you can act as another "interface layer" between departments. 
Being neutral, and approachable makes folks that may have pre-conceived ideas about other departments drop their guard and open up to reveal sometimes startling revelations about how a product is used. 

One recent case where I adopted the Switzerland Approach helped tremendously is a situation of "mistaken identity" of a group of options in the User Interface (UI). 

The options were part of a larger function in the UI that allowed conditions to be set against certain events. The problem was the group label (let's call it `Zones`) remained constant while the intent of the conditions (let's call them `Limits`) outgrew the UI nomenclature. What started out as a small, logical nomenclature grew into something so overloaded in meaning that it was confusing multiple stakeholders.

I was on my way back from the bathroom and happened to see one of our internal customers (the end-user of the product), who showed me how other parts of this system worked during my staff orientation. 
I decided to do something right then that in hindsight seems fundamental, but is something developers sometimes don't feel comfortable doing. 

*Don't ask _why_ something is the way it is. Ask someone _how_ they actually use it*

As I listened to my SME, it became crystal clear _why_ the `Zones` list was in that part of the interface, how it was used to set `Limits`, and why those `Limits` may have evolved into something no longer accurate in the UI.
Another crucial piece of information was that the `Limits` functioned more like labels for importing events. The information about the limits were not actually stored in the system, but were part of the SME's departmental Knowledgebase.

After getting a copy of the limits emailed to me with no more than a "Could I get a copy of those, please?", I quite literaly ran upstairs and told my developers what I just learned verbally. 
Some developers made assumptions that the `Zones` related to some arbitrary geographical location, but as I began explaining the relationship was actually just labels for `Limits` based on the limits document, you could see them shaking their heads in disbelief that they hadn't worked it out sooner.
They also told me that based on this information, they would need to make some minor architectural changes to parts of the system to reflect the newly-learned nomenclature. 

My advice to any Technical Writer wanting to make a difference is simple:
