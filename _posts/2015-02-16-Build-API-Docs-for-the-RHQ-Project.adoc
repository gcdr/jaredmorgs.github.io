Granted, this blog post will only likely interest the following audience:

* Red Hat associates.
* Folks using the upstream RHQ project. 
* Folks interested in techniques for generating API docs using Maven.

There are two parts to this post:

* The Original Process
* The Actual Process

== The Original Process

The original process I was told to run was:

. `$ yum install maven`
. `$ git clone https://github.com/rhq-project/rhq.git jon`
. `$ cd jon`
. `$ cd modules/enterprise/server/jar`
. `$ mvn -Ddocgen install  (or compile)`

But as I found out, there is a little more to it than that.

=== First Attempt: No Success

I ran the steps in the process, and sat back with a cuppa tea...

Note the build time...

I can't really complain about this though: the first time you build a Maven project, you can expect it to take a long time as it downloads the required dependencies.

The issue now is that I need to build the required dependencies myself before the DocGen tool can work.

=== Second Attempt: Build Deps

Luckily the folks in the RHQ project have made dependency building as simple as possible. 

In the root of the project there is this script: 

`$ ./build-deps.sh`

Run this script, and it orchestrates the dependency build process for the project. This type of automation is great for folks wanting to easily build the project. Great work RHQ team! 

The script and the resulting process completed successfully, and I thought I was ready to run DocGen.

Not. So. Fast.

=== Third Attempt: Run DogGen at Project Root

Still no bueno with DocGen.

At this point, I hit a dead end. 

I thought perhaps the following step was wrong: 

	4) `$ cd modules/enterprise/server/jar`

Perhaps I needed to execute `$ mvn -Ddocgen install` at the project root?

I executed the command at project root and things certainly looked promising. Maven began downloading a whole stack of dependencies that related to the platform. But as a Maven n00b, I learned after 11 minutes that this was a false sense of security. By executing the DocGen command at the project root, maven took the configuration in the root pom.xml file and began compiling the *entire project*. 

Should have trusted the instructions on that one. But the positive out of this was I got a refresher about how Maven works. Lets chalk this up to experience.

Build only what you need, at the level you need.

Good advice for sure.

=== Fourth Attempt: Check out the Branch, yo!

After contacting the RHQ team, it was pointed out to me that I needed to run DocGen on a branch and not the master. And I was also informed that I could cut down the build time by specifying `-DskipTests` and possibly `-Dmaven.test.skip`.

Based on this feedback, I assumed the updated steps to run were:

. `$ yum install maven`
. `$ git clone https://github.com/rhq-project/rhq.git jon`
. `$ cd jon`
. `$ git checkout -b release/_[latest_branch]_
. `$ cd modules/enterprise/server/jar`
. `$ mvn -Ddocgen compile -DskipTests -Dmaven.test.skip` (initially, then for subsequent builds)
. `$ mvn -Ddocgen install -DskipTests -Dmaven.test.skip`  


Regrettably, this updated process did not resolve the issue. I ran the compile command first, which failed. I then, out of desperation, ran the install command. It produced the same result:

== The Actual (and correct) Process

We're getting there, but there is still quite a path to traverse down before I can comfortably say "generating RHQ API docs is easy".

The https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1192869[BugZilla Bug] I raised to capture these challenges will hopefully help the engineers with resolving the issue for me, and for users of the project.
