If you want to use a custom domain in HubPress, it is pretty easy to do it. The trick is knowing about the importance of an `A` DNS record pointing to some specific GitHub IP addresses.

== Step 1 - Get a domain

I chose Dreamhost for my domain name registrar, based on some testimonials. 

Pay for a domain and once it is registered and parked, you can continue.

== Step 2 - Add CNAME to HubPress

. Open the HubPress Admin Console
. Click `Settings`.
. In the `CNAME` field, type in your domain name. You don't need the `www` prefix.
. Save your changes.

== Step 3 - Add an `A` Record to your domain name provider

Thanks to the HubPress founder, Anthonny, he found a http://stackoverflow.com/a/20483041/5778580[Stack Overflow Q&A] that worked perfectlly with Dreamhost.

.How to add an A Record for GitHub Pages
. Go to menu:Domains[Manage Domains] in your webpanel.
. Locate `yournewdomain.com`, and click `Edit` in the Actions column.
. Scroll to the bottom of the webpanel and switch to "DNS Only" hosting.
. Return to menu:Domains[Manage Domains] in your webpanel.
. Click the `DNS` link below `yournewdomain.com`.
. Add an `A` record:
* Name = (blank, nothing)
* Type = `A`
* Value = `192.30.252.153`

NOTE: The latest list of IP addresses is available from https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider/#configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider[this GitHub Help article]

The steps—and menu transitions—may differ from provider to provider, but the important thing is to get those GitHub IP addresses added to each `A` record. Once you do that, your domain will redirect perfectly. 

If you are using GitHub to host any other static sites that used your old `username.github.io` address, they will automatically redirect over to `yournewdomain.com` and maintain their absolute path, which is pretty neat. No dead links for your disparate sites that may have got quite a following. Now all under the one managed domain.
